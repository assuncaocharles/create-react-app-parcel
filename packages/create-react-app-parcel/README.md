# Create React App Parcel 💩

> create react apps with parcel instead of webpack cos why not

Preconfigured Features that come with your Parcel setup:

- [babel-preset-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/next/packages/babel-preset-react-app) so you can use the exact same JS features that come with create-react-app (eg public class fields)
- improved `App.js` to show off the babel preset features (click on the React logo!)
- serviceWorker available but off by default (similar to the coming create-react-app 2.0 setup)
- [preconfigured build setup](https://github.com/sw-yx/create-react-app-parcel/blob/master/packages/react-scripts-parcel/config/parcel.config.prod.js) based on the [ParcelJS API](https://parceljs.org/api.html)
- nice eject experience that doesnt saddle you with a million webpack plugins
- as far as possible, same DX as create-react-app (eg checks if you use `yarn` or `npm`, environment variables all the same)
  - in particular it's a fork of create-react-app v2.0 so you also get features like [babel-plugin-macros](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlAHtAQlFGk&list=WL&index=38) for free! 🔥

# Using C.R.A.P.

```bash
npx create-react-app-parcel my-app

## or install it:
# npm i -g create-react-app-parcel
# crap my-app

cd my-app
yarn start
```

and presto! (try clicking the react icon)

# C.R.A.P. structure

You will have a very simple folder structure, same as `create-react-app`:

```
my-app
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
├── public
│   └── favicon.ico
│   └── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src
    └── App.css
    └── App.js
    └── App.test.js
    └── index.css
    └── index.js
    └── logo.svg
    └── registerServiceWorker.js
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.

# `react-scripts-parcel` API guide

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

⚠️ warning: this functionality is untested for now

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>

Your app is ready to be deployed.

### `yarn eject`

ejects you out of this shiznit like so

Also for **Typescript** users a custom script exists: https://github.com/sw-yx/create-react-app-parcel-typescript
